# Claude Instructions for Megakernels

This repo focuses on the development of GPU megakernels. See @docs/spinup.md for a high-level overview of the what megakernels are and how to develop them in this repo.

Currently, the active development is on our high-throughput implementation of tensor-parallel Llama-70B. See @docs/tp_llama.md for a high-level overview of the implementation.
